# K Medoids algorithm for censored data 

#### This code corresponds to the pre-print version of paper **K-Medoids algorithm modification for censored data**. 
#### In this paper we present a modified version of K-medoids algorithm which can discover meaningful clusters both in terms of features but also in terms of survivability.
#### For this purpose we have introduced a custom distance metric which considers lifetime distribution differences and spatial differences like in the traditional K-medoids algorithm (e.g., euclidean distance)
#### However, the repository is currently under development.
#### Stay tuned and the repository will be updated soon. Cheers!!!
